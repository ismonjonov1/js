# JavaScript stuff...

### 1. Do you have Node installed?
Check if you have node:
```
node -v
```
If it displays the version like this:
```
sina-3:js Sina$ node -v
v7.5.0
```
Then you're fine. That means you have Node.
If not, download from `https://nodejs.org/en/` and install.

### 2. Go into a directory
```
cd ONE_OF_THE_DIRECTORIES
```

### 3. Run using node
```
node index.js
```
